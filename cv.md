There is my code example form RS-Lang App. Code checks answer and updates words difficulty.
```javascript
function answerBtnClick(answer) {
    setShowAnswers(false);
    if (answer !== question.isCorrectTranslation) {
      updateWordStatistic(10, true);
      playSound(incorrectAnswerSound);
      setLives(lives - 1);
    } else {
      playSound(correctAnswerSound);
      updateWordStatistic(-10, false);
    } answerArr = answers;
    answerArr.push(answer);
    setAnswers(answerArr);
